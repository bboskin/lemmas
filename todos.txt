Things to do going forward:

Extend the initial language:
  - numbers (need to implement numbers in MK)
  - more boolean expressions

Optimize miniKanren code generated:
  - stop from recurring on symbols

Contract Completion:
  - infer types of variables based on contexts

Use test?/itest? to generate tests:
  - using Pete's API should work

Have it be friendly! make suggestions! etc.
